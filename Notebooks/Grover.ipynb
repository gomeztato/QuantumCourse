    "This exercise will implement the Grover's algorithm to find a the solution to a function that select the state: |01010>=|10>.\n",
    "The algorithm needs an additional qubit (ancilla). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ths algorithm steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Allocate a register with 6 qubits: 5 for applying the oracle and one ancilla\n",
    "2. Initialize the ancilla qubit to |1>\n",
    "3. Apply a Walsh-Hadamard operator to all the qubits in the quantum register.\n",
    "4. Apply the Grover's operator that includes the oracle and the diffusion operator.\n",
