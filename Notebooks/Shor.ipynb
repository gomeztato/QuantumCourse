    "## Shor's factoring algorithm\n",

    "This exercise is based on the [ProjectQ](http://projectq.ch/) example. You can get the original uncommented code at [ProjectQ repository](https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ/blob/develop/examples/shor.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is based on the paper [Parker S. and Planio M.B,Efficient factorization with a single pure qubit and logN mixed qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0001066v3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's quantum algorithm is a semiclassical algorithm where one of the steps, looking for the period od a function, is executed on a QPU because it has a better scalability with the number of bits of the number to factor. In the future, when the Quantum Computers can execute large programs, it can beat the most used asymmetric cryptographic algorithm: RSA. This algorithm is based on the assumption that it is very hard to compute the factors of a large number. Shor's algorithm and the experimental proof of the possibility of implementing it in QPUs (for factoring only very small numbers: [15](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0112176) and [21](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4147)) started the Post-Quantum era, where new cryptographic algorithms are needed. \n",
